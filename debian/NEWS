fwknop (2.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  If you are upgrading from a previous version of fwknop you will want to
  read the following information on backwards compatibility.

  http://www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop/docs/fwknop-tutorial.html#backwards-compatibility

  In short, fwknop-2.5 is compatible with prior versions, but it requires one
  configuration tweak to either the client (add "-M legacy" to the command
  line) or server config (add "ENCRYPTION_MODE legacy" to each stanza in the
  access.conf file) if you wish to run a mixed environment of older clients
  and/or older servers. The reason for the incompatibility is that prior to
  2.5, fwknop was not properly using PBKDF1 for Rijndael key derivation
  - this has been fixed. 
  
  A new libfko python binding package is available has libfko-python.
